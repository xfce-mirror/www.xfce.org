<b>2005/03/04 - Xfce Weekly News - February, 25, 2004 through March 3, 2005</b>

<p>Welcome to Xfce Weekly News, your source for up to the week information on Xfce developments, mailing lists goings on, and Xfce related news items.</p>

<blockquote>

<b>Xfce Foundation Classes - First Release</b>
<p>In October of last year Jeff Franks made an interesting proposition on the Xfce-Dev list. Jeff had developed a relatively complete and lightweight GTK+ binding for C++ called GTK+ Foundation Classes. For a number of reasons, Jeff felt that GFC needed a new home, and Xfce seemed the best bet.</p>

<p>Now, after many months of hard work, Jeff announced the new Xfce Foundation Classes, with a first developer release and stack of well written documentation, all available from the new <a href=?http://xfc.xfce.org?XFC website</a>. The website makes clear that Jeff intends to not only bind GLib/GTK+, but bind the core Xfce libraries as well, making it easy to use various Xfce widgets and utilities in C++ apps.</p>

<p>If you are a C++ developer, please give the new bindings a try. And then thank Jeff for writing them!</p>

<b>The Move to Subversion</b>

<p>Comments on the move to Subversion continued this week. Previously, it had been decided to move various non core projects into the Xfce repository (such as <a href=http://spuriousinterrupt.org/projects/xfmedia/>Xfmedia</a> and <a href=http://www.os-cillation.com/article.php?sid=48>libexo</a>. It was also decided that this would be as good an excuse and a time as any to make the move to Subversion.</p>

<p>The only remaining questions have been "When" and "How". The answers seem to be "This weekend" and "Not sure". Brian J. Tarricone provided a rundown of the various things that he felt were needed in a version control system, and a repository layout. </p>

<p>A final answer is coming, but what it will look like is uncertain.</p>

<b>Xfce Removed From Fedora Core 4</b>

<p>It seems that Xfce has been removed from Fedora Core 4. Some cordial discussion on the Xfce lists asked whether or not this was a prudent action by Fedora, and what users could do about it.</p>

<p>What to include or exclude is ultimately up to the Fedora developers, and it seems that the Fedora packages will still be available through Fedora Extras. As for what users can do about it, either use the extras packages or migrate to another distro/OS. Brian also pointed out that if enough users want Xfce, then a few polite emails might go a long way.</p>

<b>Thunar - A New File Manager For Xfce</b>

<p>Xffm continues to be the file manager of mixed feelings. Some people swear by it, some people hate it, and most people find it to have a high learning curve.</p>

<p>A new project and mailing list have cropped up to develop Thunar, the new file manager for Xfce. The goal is to be simple, easy to use, and easy to learn. Benedikt Meurer is manning the project, and Edscott Wilson Garcia (the Xffm maintainer) seems to view the friendly competition as being good for both projects. Certainly development on Xffm will continue, and the modular nature of Xfce will allow users to run either file manager, or both, or none, as they like.</p>

<p>Thunar (whose name may or may not change in the future) is taking an interesting but well thought out design path. Specifically, since Thunar was born out of the need to feel a specific niche in terms of UI, the UI is being prototyped in Python, with strong mailing list feedback and an active <a href=http://thunar.xfce.org/wiki/>wiki</a> There has been some concern that since Benedikt is himself not the target user of his own project, the UI may be compromised. However, there are plenty of target users on the mailing list, and Benedikt is known for hard work, well planned.</p>

<p>With two file managers with clearly different target user bases, the future looks bright for all of us.</p>

<h4>Tidbits</h4>

<p>While they may not be earth shattering, the various mailing lists and geek news sites will have little nuggets of interest from time to time. Here is this week?s.</p>

<b>Xfce in the News</b>
<p>PC World has an <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,119699,00.asp">article</a> on Xfce. As time wears on, Xfce gets more and more coverage.</p>

<b>Panel Plugins in the Home Directory</b>
<p>Jason Keltz asked why per user plugin installs did not work. Jasper responded that it had in the past and it might again in the future. Jason provided some reasons for getting the feature working again.</p>

<b>Mousepad Development Stalled?</b>
<p>Dennis J. Tuchler asked if Mousepad was still under development, and whether it would be included in the Xfce core. He was assured that development continued, but that the core would likely be getting slimmer, not fatter.</p>

<b>The Prodigal Son Returns</b>
<p>After a few months of being busy with other things Eduard Roccatello returned to the mailing list, and assured us that patched would be coming. Welcome back Eduard!</p>

<b>Daichi Kawahata - I18N Ninja</b>
<p>Daichi continued his work in I18N, submitting a patch to intltoolize Xffm, and a Japanese contents.xml for the panel. Go Daichi!</p>

<b>Xfprint License</b>
<p>Jean-François Wauthy asked Benedikt if he could change the license for Xfprint from BSD to GPL. Benedikt approved.</p>

<b>CVS - A Roll of the Dice</b>
<p>After Daichi asked about the large number of warnings generated by libxfcegui4, Jasper reminded him that CVS (at least right now) was made to be broken.</p>

<b>Weekly News</b>
<p>Erik Harrison proposed to write a summary of mailing list goings on, and various other announcements, and call it Xfce Weekly News. He was heartily encouraged, especially since he was willing to write it himself.</p><br>

<b>2005/01/16 - Xfce 4.2.0 released</b>
    </h3>

    <p>
      Today the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce project</a> has released
      version 4.2.0 of its Desktop Environment and Development Framework for
      Unix and Unix-like platforms, based on the GTK+ toolkit and designed to
      comply with the relevant <a href="http://freedesktop.org/">Freedesktop</a>
      specifications. It can be downloaded <a href="http://www.xfce.org/index.php?page=download&lang=zh">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>

      Xfce 4.2 is the first desktop environment to ship with an easy-to-use
      and platform-independent graphical installation wizard, which
      takes care of compiling and installing both Xfce and any contributed
      packages on your computer.  Visit the <a
      href="http://xfce-installers.os-cillation.com/">os-cillation installer
      website</a> for download links and instructions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new Xfce desktop, while still being lightweight and easy to install,
      offers several new and awaited features in comparison with its previous
      4.0 stable release like a brand new session manager, keyboard shortcuts,
      a graphical desktop menu editor, multihead support (Xinerama and
      Multi-Screen mode), Kiosk Mode support (to lock down Xfce in cooporative
      environments), optional support for
      icons in the desktop menu, a desktop menu plugin for the panel,
      CUPS and BSD-LPR printing support, a new icon theme, and various
      other small enhancements. Moreover, Xfce 4.2 provides bleeding-edge
      features, like a compositing manager for xfwm4 (a manager for
      the new X.org Composite extension, which brings true transparency to the
      Xfce Desktop) and support for the XDG base directory specification (see
      <a href="http://www.xfce.org/%7Ebenny/file-locations.html">this page</a>
      for an explanation of the new file locations). A
      complete list of changes between Xfce 4.0 and 4.2 is available

<p><i>About the Xfce Project :</i> The Xfce Project is a collaboration of international developers working together to develop a desktop environment that is both lightweight and full featured.  Keeping with the Unix philosophy of small, modular programs that are very good at doing one thing, the Xfce Project has created a desktop environment which consists of lightweight components which can be strung together in virtually any configuration to create a desktop solution that fits any user just right.</p>

<b>2004/10/30 - Xfce 4.2 BETA2 is out</b>

<p>Today, the Xfce project is proud to announce the release of version <b>4.2-beta2</b> of its Desktop Environment and development framework. Xfce is designed for Unix platforms using the GTK+ toolkit, and follows the Freedesktop specifications. It can be downloaded from <a href="index.php?page=download&lang=zh">here</a>.</p>

<p>Xfce 4.2-beta2 is the first desktop environment to ship with an easy to use <b>graphical installation wizard</b>, which takes care of compiling and installing Xfce and contributed packages on your computer. See <a href="http://xfce-installers.os-cillation.com/">here</a> for download links and instructions.</p>

<p>This second beta version offers several new and awaited features in comparison with the previous 4.0 stable release, while continuing to be lightweight, including a brand new session manager, keyboard shortcut and desktop menu graphical editors, multihead support (Xinerama and real multiscreen), "kiosk mode" support, optional support for icons in the desktop menu, a desktop menu plugin for the panel, CUPS and BSD-LPR printing support, and a new icon theme.  Moreover, Xfce 4.2 provides "cutting edge" features, such as a compositing manager for xfwm4 (a manager for the new Xorg compositor extension, which brings true transparency to the Xfce desktop), as well as support for the base directory specification.  Xfce is now available in more than 25 languages.</p>

<p>We hope that you will give this release a try. Please report any bugs or issues with this release on the <a href="http://bugzilla.xfce.org/"><b>Xfce bug tracker</b></a> or on the <a href="http://lunar-linux.org/mailman/listinfo/xfce4-dev">Xfce development list</a>.</p>

<li>xfdesktop : The desktop background and root window menu manager.</li>
<li>xfce4-session : The session manager, which allows you to restore your desktop the way you left it.</li>
<li>xffm : A fast file manager, with double pane and integrated samba network browser.</li>
<li>xfce-utils : Provides the Xfce user guide, and, among other tools, xftaskbar4, a separate taskbar that provides an intuitive way to manage windows.</li>
