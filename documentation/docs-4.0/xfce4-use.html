      which includes the panel, the window manager and the desktop manager. 
      All programs, or symbolic links to programs, in 
      <tt class="filename">~/Desktop/Autostart/</tt> will be run on startup.
    </p><p>
      To customize the behaviour of <b class="application"><tt>startxfce4</tt></b>, 
      copy the file <tt class="filename">${sysconfdir}/xfce4/xinitrc</tt> to your 
      personal <tt class="filename">~/.xfce4/</tt> directory and edit that file.
    </p><p>
      Depending on your installation method the location of the system
      <tt class="filename">xinitrc</tt> file may be different. If you 
      install from source, <tt class="filename">${sysconfdir}</tt> defaults to 
      <tt class="filename">/usr/local/etc</tt>. For binary packages it is often 
      set to <tt class="filename">/etc</tt>; you can use your package manager to
      find out.
    </p><p>      
      Finally, the copied <tt class="filename">xinitrc</tt> file has to be made 
      executable:

      all funtionality, but rather it tries to adhere to the old UNIX
      tradition of small tools that do one job and do it well. A default 
      XFce 4 desktop with no programs running is shown in 
      <a href="xfce4-use.html#default-session-fig" title="Figure 1. Default XFce 4 session">Figure 1, &#8220;Default XFce 4 session&#8221;</a>.

	      and taskbar.
	    "></div></div></div><p>When you run <b class="application"><tt>startxfce4</tt></b> several
      applications are started:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Taskbar</span></dt><dd><p>At the top of the screen you will see the taskbar. It shows
	    the applications running on the current workspace. You can
	    focus the application by clicking on the button in the taskbar.
	    Clicking the button again will hide the application. The taskbar
	    also contains a graphical pager showing a miniature view of all 
	    your workspaces. You can even move windows to another workspace by
	    draggin the miniwindow in the pager. Initially invisible is the
	    notification area or system tray. This will only do something when
	    an application uses a status icon. An example is the instant
	    messaging application <b class="application"><tt>gaim</tt></b>.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Panel</span></dt><dd><p>At the bottom of the screen is the XFce4 panel. It allows you
	    to run applications and also contains a graphical pager, a clock
	    and a mail checker. Some items have an associated panel menu that
	    gives access to more applications. Panel menus are opened by
	    pressing the small arrow buttons next to the associated panel item.
	    Changing the content of the panel and the properties of the items
	    is done by using the right mouse button. Both the panel items and
	    the panel move handles have a right-click mouse menu from where
	    you can chage the panel configuration. For more information look
	    at the <a href="xfce4-panel.html" target="_top">panel
	      manual</a>.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Desktop Manager</span></dt><dd><p>The desktop manager provides the desktop background image and
	    two menus when you click on the desktop background.
	  </p><p>The right mouse button opens a menu that allows you to start 
	    applications. Look at the <a href="xfdesktop.html" target="_top">manual</a> to find out how to change the menu 
	    contents.
	  </p><p>The middle mouse button (or Shift + left click) opens a list of
	    all applications that are currently running. You can activate an
	    application by clicking on its menu entry.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Window Manager</span></dt><dd><p>The window manager is responsible for placing the windows on
	    the screen and provides the window borders and decorations. It
	    allows you to move windows around by draggin the titlebar and
	    provides title bar buttons, for example to close, minimize or
	    maximize a window. Look at the <a href="xfwm4.html" target="_top">manual</a> for a full explanation of the window 
	    manager.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Settings Manager</span></dt><dd><p>The settings manager runs in the background and makes sure
	    that all XFce 4 applications update their settings when the user 
	    changes something in the settings manager dialog (see following
	    section) and takes care of reading the configuration from disk at 
	    startup.

      quickly get you started working with XFce 4. Because that is what
      XFce 4 is designed for, to allow you to get work done.
    </p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2449684"></a>Running programs</h4></div></div><div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">XFce 4 panel</span></dt><dd><p>The panel is designed to allow quick access to the most
	      frequently used applications by putting them on the main panel.
	      Less often used applications can be put in a panel menu. 
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Desktop menu</span></dt><dd><p>Another method for starting applications is from the desktop
	      mouse menu. Read the <b class="application"><tt>xfdesktop</tt></b> <a href="xfdesktop.html" target="_top">manual</a> for
	      information on how to change the menu contents.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Run dialog</span></dt><dd><p>If you know the name of a program and it is not on the panel
	      or in the desktop menu you can use the run dialog. To open the
	      dialog type  or choose the 'Run
	      program...' option from the desktop menu.
	    </p><p>The dialog will remeber the 10 last commands that were
	      successfully executed.

	      title bar. A window can be closed, hidden, maximized, shaded and
	      made sticky &#8212; this means it will show up on all workspaces
	      &#8212; by using the title bar buttons.
	    </p><p>Right clicking on the title bar will open a menu that gives
	      access to all window operations.</p><p>Shading a window, which means collapsing it to only show the
	      title bar, can also be accomplished by using the mouse wheel
	      over the title bar. Up is shade, down is unshade.
	    </p><p>If you want maximized windows to not cover the entire screen
	      you can set workspace margins from the settings manager dialog
	      (see below).
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Application management</span></dt><dd><p>To find out what applications are currently running you can
	      look at the taskbar. Clicking on a button in the taskbar will
	      focus the associated application. Clicking again will hide it.
	    </p><p>When you click with the middle mouse button on the desktop 
	      background a list of windows is shown, ordered by workspace. 
	      You can activate the application or change workspaces by 
	      choosing the appropriate menu entry.
	    </p><p>
	      The <b class="application"><tt>xfce4-iconbox</tt></b> application can 
	      also be used to keep track of running applications.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Workspaces</span></dt><dd><p>You can change workspaces by clicking on them in the
	      graphical pager, either on the taskbar or on the panel. Pressing
	       or 
	       will cycle through the
	      workspaces. Using the mousewheel over the pager or the desktop
	      background will have the same effect.
	    </p><p>To add or remove workspaces you can use the middle click
	      desktop menu or the settings dialog (see below).

	preferences of many XFce 4 applications. You can run it by pressing 
	its laucher on the panel, from the right click menu on the panel
	move handles or from the desktop mouse menu.
      </p><p>Preference dialogs for many aspects of the XFce 4 desktop 
	environment are available. The available options are described in the
