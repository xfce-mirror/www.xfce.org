      which includes the session manager, the panel, the taskbar, the window 
      manager and the desktop manager. 
      All programs (or symbolic links to programs) in 
      <tt class="filename">~/Desktop/Autostart/</tt> will be run on startup (note
      that this directory does not exist by default and you may have to create
      it).
    </p><p>By default the Xfce session manager manages the startup of
      applications. It allows you to save your session when you quit Xfce, so
      that the next time you log in, the same applications will be started for 
      you automatically.
    </p><p>
      To customize the behaviour of <b class="application"><tt>startxfce4</tt></b>, 
      copy the file <tt class="filename">${sysconfdir}/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc</tt> to 
      your personal <tt class="filename">~/.config/xfce4/</tt> 
      directory and edit that file.  Depending on your installation method the 
      location of the system <tt class="filename">xinitrc</tt> file may be 
      different. If you install from source, <tt class="filename">${sysconfdir}</tt> defaults to <tt class="filename">/usr/local/etc/</tt>. For binary packages
      it is often set to <tt class="filename">/etc/</tt>, 
      <tt class="filename">/etc/X11</tt>,
      <tt class="filename">/usr/pkg/etc</tt> or
      <tt class="filename">/usr/X11R6/etc</tt>;
      you can use your package manager to find out.

      all funtionality, but rather it tries to adhere to the old UNIX
      tradition of small tools that do one job and do it best. A default 
      Xfce 4 desktop with no programs running is shown in 
      <a href="xfce4-use.html#default-session-fig" title="Figure 1. Default Xfce 4 session">Figure 1, &#8220;Default Xfce 4 session&#8221;</a>.
    </p><div class="figure"><a name="default-session-fig"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 1. Default Xfce 4 session</b></p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/default-session.png" alt="Shows default Xfce session, with background manager, panel 
	      and taskbar.
	    "></div></div></div><p>
      When you run <b class="application"><tt>startxfce4</tt></b> for the first
      time, several applications are started by the Xfce session manager:
    </p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Taskbar</span></dt><dd><p>At the top of the screen you will see the taskbar. It shows
	    the applications running on the current workspace. You can
	    focus the application by clicking on the button in the taskbar.
	    Clicking again will hide the application. If you use the right
	    mouse button, a menu will appear, allowing you to perform several 
	    actions on the application window. 
	  </p><p>
	    The taskbar can optionally contain a graphical pager showing a 
	    miniature view of all your workspaces and a notification area or 
	    system tray. 
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Panel</span></dt><dd><p>At the bottom of the screen is the Xfce4 panel. It allows you
	    to run applications and also contains a graphical pager, a clock
	    and a mail checker. Some items have an associated panel menu that
	    gives access to more applications. Panel menus are opened by
	    pressing the small arrow buttons next to the panel item.
	  </p><p>
	    Changing the content of the panel and the properties of the items
	    is done by using the right mouse button. Both the panel items and
	    the panel move handles have a right-click mouse menu from where
	    you can chage the panel configuration. For more information look
	    at the <a href="xfce4-panel.html" target="_top">panel
	      manual</a>.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Desktop Manager</span></dt><dd><p>The desktop manager provides the desktop background image and
	    two menus when you click on the desktop background.
	  </p><p>The right mouse button opens a menu that allows you to start 
	    applications. Look at the <a href="xfdesktop.html" target="_top">manual</a> to find out how to change the menu 
	    contents.
	  </p><p>The middle mouse button (or Shift + left click) opens a list of
	    all applications that are currently running. You can activate an
	    application by clicking on its menu entry.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Window Manager</span></dt><dd><p>The window manager is responsible for placing the windows on
	    the screen and provides the window borders and decorations. It
	    allows you to move windows around by draggin the titlebar and
	    provides title bar buttons, for example to close, minimize or
	    maximize a window. Look at the <a href="xfwm4.html" target="_top">manual</a> for a full explanation of the window 
	    manager.
	  </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Settings Manager</span></dt><dd><p>The settings manager runs in the background and makes sure
	    that all Xfce 4 applications update their settings when the user 
	    changes something in the settings manager dialog (see following
	    section) and takes care of reading the configuration from disk at 
	    startup. Look at the <a href="xfce-mcs-manager.html" target="_top">Settings Manager</a> and <a href="xfce-mcs-plugins.html" target="_top">Settings Plugins</a>
            manuals for a full explanation of the settings manager.

      quickly get you started working with Xfce 4. Because that is what
      Xfce 4 is designed for, to allow you to get work done.
    </p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2534007"></a>Running programs</h4></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Xfce 4 panel</span></dt><dd><p>The panel is designed to allow quick access to the most
	      frequently used applications by putting them on the main panel.
	      Less often used applications can be put in a panel menu. 
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Desktop menu</span></dt><dd><p>Another method for starting applications is from the desktop
	      mouse menu. Read the <a href="xfdesktop.html" target="_top">Desktop Manager manual</a> for
	      information on how to change the menu contents.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Run dialog</span></dt><dd><p>
              If you know the name of a program and it is not on the panel
	      or in the desktop menu you can use the run dialog. To open the
	      dialog type <span><b class="keycap">Alt+F2</b></span> or choose the <span><b class="guilabel">Run
	      program...</b></span> option from the desktop menu.
	    </p><p>
              The dialog will remeber the 10 last commands that were
	      executed successfully.
	    </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2534077"></a>Managing windows and workspaces</h4></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Basic window operations</span></dt><dd><p>You can move windows around the screen by dragging their
	      title bar. A window can be closed, hidden, maximized, shaded and
	      made sticky &#8212; this means it will show up on all workspaces
	      &#8212; by using the title bar buttons.
	    </p><p>Right clicking on the title bar will open a menu that gives
	      access to all window operations.</p><p>Shading a window, which means collapsing it to only show the
	      title bar, can also be accomplished by using the mouse wheel
	      over the title bar. Mouse wheel up is shade, mouse wheel down 
              is unshade.
	    </p><p>If you want maximized windows to not cover the entire screen
	      you can set workspace margins from the settings manager dialog
	      (see below).
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Application management</span></dt><dd><p>To find out what applications are currently running you can
	      look at the taskbar. Clicking on a button in the taskbar will
	      focus the associated application. Clicking again will hide it.
	    </p><p>When you click with the middle mouse button on the desktop 
	      background a list of windows is shown, ordered by workspace. 
	      You can activate the application or change workspaces by 
	      choosing the appropriate menu entry.
	    </p><p>
	      The <b class="application"><tt>xfce4-iconbox</tt></b> application can 
	      also be used to keep track of running applications.
	    </p></dd><dt><span class="term">Workspaces</span></dt><dd><p>You can change workspaces by clicking on them in the
	      graphical pager, either on the taskbar or on the panel. Pressing 
	      <span><b class="keycap">Ctrl+Alt+LeftArrow</b></span> or
              <span><b class="keycap">Ctrl+Alt+RightArrow</b></span> will cycle through the
	      workspaces. Using the mousewheel over the pager or the desktop
	      background has the same effect.
	    </p><p>To add or remove workspaces you can use the middle click
	      desktop menu or the settings dialog (see below).
	    </p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id2534162"></a>Using the settings manager dialog</h4></div></div></div><p>The settings manager dialog provides access to the global
	preferences of many Xfce 4 applications. You can run it by pressing 
	its laucher on the panel, from the desktop mouse menu or by running
	<b class="application"><tt>xfce-setting-show</tt></b>.
      </p><p>Dialogs to change many aspects of the Xfce 4 desktop 
	environment are available. See the separate manuals of the Xfce 4 
	components for more information. It may be interesting to have a quick
	look at all the dialogs to find out what options are available that
	allow you to create the best possible working environment.
