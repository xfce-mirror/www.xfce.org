"Today, after 1 year and 4 months of work, we are happy to announce the "
"release of the Xfce desktop 4.16, a new stable version that supersedes Xfce "
"4.14."
msgstr ""
"Vandaag, na één jaar en vier maanden werk, zijn we verheugd omdat we de "
"uitgifte kunnen aankondigen van versie 4.10 van de Xfce-werkomgeving, een "
"nieuwe stabiele versie die Xfce 4.8 opvolgt."

#: news-array.php:16
msgid ""
"4.16 was a special cycle in many respects (not only pandemic-wise, but "
"also). One of the corner-stones of the non-code changes concerns our "
"migration to GitLab, which is a change in development workflow and a huge "
"step forward in terms of becoming more contributor-friendly and welcoming. "
"In parts, the <a href=\"https://www.xfce.org/download/"
"changelogs/4.16\">humungous changelog of Xfce 4.16</a> can be attributed to "
"new contributors proposing merge requests (288 merge requests were merged or "
"closed against our core components alone!). We also created a reference "
"Docker container (<a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/xfce/xfce-build\">xfce/"
"xfce-build</a>) and added CI pipelines to all components to ensure we don´t "
"break the build. None of this would have been possible without our hosting "
"being sponsored by <a href=\"https://gandi.net\">Gandi</a> and <a href="
"\"https://fosshost.org\">Fosshost</a>!"

#: news-array.php:17
msgid ""
"Another big change concerns our visual identity, which we updated from a "
"strange mix of random (partly Tango-based) icons and not following any "
"naming scheme to a new, visually consistent set (following the freedesktop."
"org naming specification and a fixed color palette). We´re aware this will "
"generate some work for icon theme maintainers (if they really want to "
"override our gorgeous icons ;)) but we believe the longterm benefit "
"outweighs this one-time effort."
msgstr ""

#: news-array.php:19
msgid ""
"And then finally we did some housekeeping (e.g. by dropping Gtk2 support "
"code) and we also added features and improvements - all while sticking to a "

"The <a href=\"https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfwm4/start\">window manager</a> "

"and GLX. If a primary display was set, the alt-tab dialog will now only be "
"shown there. Furthermore some handy new options to zoom the cursor along "
"with rest of the display as well as an option to keep minimized windows in "
"the most recently used list complement this release."

#: news-array.php:24

"We added a new plugin to the <a href=\"https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-"
"panel/start\">panel</a> dubbed \"statustray\" which combines both "
"StatusNotifier and legacy Systray items. An animated autohide transition now "
"clearly shows the user \"where the panel has gone\" and a dark mode (enabled "
"by default) makes the panel drop into the background a bit more with bright "
"themes like the Gtk default Adwaita. Quite a few more smaller improvements "
"were also introduced like accessing desktop actions from a Launcher´s right-"
"click menu, the Window Buttons plugin now offering to `Launch a new "
"instance` of an application and the Workspace Switcher now optionally "
"showing automatic numbering for workspaces."
msgstr ""

"Support for fractional scaling was added to the <a href=\"https://docs.xfce."
"org/xfce/xfce4-settings/display\">display dialog</a>, along with "

"and more responsive interaction with the thumbnail generator. Because we "
"have not decided on how to merge the desktop functionality into Thunar yet, "
"Xfdesktop has instead received various improvements, including single-click "
"support, desktop icon thumbnails and better pasting of files. The Session "
