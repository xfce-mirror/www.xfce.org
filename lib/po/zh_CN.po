"Since we're following the Xfce <a href=\"/about/releasemodel\">release "
"model</a> for 4.8, we'd normally announce code freeze and the creation of "
"early lifecycle support branches today. We decided against this because "
"there are not enough people active to take care of all this at the moment. "
"So we will continue fixing bugs in master branches as we did between 4.8pre2"

"This release incorporates major changes to the core of the Xfce desktop "
"environment and hopefully succeeds in fulfilling a number of long time "
"requests. Among the most notable updates is that we have ported the entire "
"Xfce core (Thunar, xfdesktop and thunar-volman in particular) from ThunarVFS"
" to GIO, bringing remote filesystems to the Xfce desktop. The panel has been"
" rewritten from scratch and provides better launcher management and improved"
" multi-head support. The list of new panel features is too long to mention "
"in its entirety here. Thanks to the new menu library garcon (formerly known "
"as libxfce4menu, but rewritten once again) we now support menu editing via a"
" third-party menu editor such as Alacarte (we do not ship our own yet). Our "
"core libraries have been streamlined a bit, a good example being the newly "
"introduced libxfce4ui library which is meant to replace libxfcegui4."
msgstr "此版本将主要改进合并入 Xfce 桌面环境的核心，但愿我们胜利地完成了许多长时间的提请。其中最显著的更新是我们已经将整个 Xfce 核心(Thunar、Xfdesktop，特别是 thunar-volman)由 ThunarVFS 导入到 GIO，将远程文件系统带入 Xfce 桌面。面板已经从头重写并提供更好的启动器管理和改进了的多传感头支持。新面板的功能太长而不能在此完整地提及。归功于新的菜单库文件 Garcon(以前所知的 libxfce4menu，但再次重写)，现在我们支持由第三方菜单编辑器编辑菜单，如 Alacarte(还没有发送我们自己的)。我们的核心库文件已经提高了一点效率，一个好例子是新引入的用来取代 libxfcegui4 的 libxfce4ui 库文件。"
