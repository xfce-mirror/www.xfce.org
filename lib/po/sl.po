"default. Basic Synaptics and Wacom settings in the Mouse settings and a new "
"MIME-Type editor. Thunar gained a more polished layout to reduce space usage"
" and more responsive interaction with the thumbnail generator. Because we "
"have not decided on how to merge the desktop functionality into Thunar yet, "
"Xfdesktop has instead received various improvements, including single-click "
"support, desktop icon thumbnails and better pasting of files. The Session "
"Manager has improved power management code, tips have been removed and "

"now has support for tiling windows and arrow key navigation in the task "
"switcher."
msgstr "Ta izdaja vsebuje velike spremembe v samem jedru Xfce namiznega okolja. Upamo, da bo uspela zadovoljiti številnim dolgo pričakovanim zahtevam. Med bolj opaznimi posodobitvami je novi iskalnik programov, ki združuje funkcionalnost starega appfinder in xfrun4. Pano odslej ponuja navpični način [Deskbar] za boljše izkoristek prostora na širokih zaslonih in nove vtičnike za razna dejanja. Pri nastavitvah je prišlo do integracije pomoči za nastavitve v xfsettingsd, kar odpravi 1 zagnano storitev. Nastavitveni dialog je predelan s kategorijami in privzetimi priključnimi dialogi . Dodane so osnovne Synaptic in Wacom nastavitve v nastavitvah za miško in nov urejevalnik za MIME-Type. Thunar ima bolj dovršen videz, ki zmanjša porabo prostora, hkrati je bolj odziven pri delu z generatorjem sličic za predogled. Ker se še nismo odločili, kako bomo namizno funkcionalnost integrirali v Thunar, smo izboljšali Xfdesktop z zadevami, kot so podpora za enojni klik, ikone s predogledom in boljšim lepljenjem datotek. Upravljalnik sej ima izbojlšano kodo za upravljanje porabe energije, namigi so bili odstranjeni, boljše je čiščenje ostankov sej. Nenazadnje Window Manager odslej podpira razdeljevanje oken, ter navigacijo s smernimi tipkami v preklopniku procesov."

"This release incorporates major changes to the core of the Xfce desktop "
"environment and hopefully succeeds in fulfilling a number of long time "
"requests. Among the most notable updates is that we have ported the entire "
"Xfce core (Thunar, xfdesktop and thunar-volman in particular) from ThunarVFS"
" to GIO, bringing remote filesystems to the Xfce desktop. The panel has been"
" rewritten from scratch and provides better launcher management and improved"
" multi-head support. The list of new panel features is too long to mention "
"in its entirety here. Thanks to the new menu library garcon (formerly known "
"as libxfce4menu, but rewritten once again) we now support menu editing via a"
" third-party menu editor such as Alacarte (we do not ship our own yet). Our "
"core libraries have been streamlined a bit, a good example being the newly "
"introduced libxfce4ui library which is meant to replace libxfcegui4."

"Perhaps the most important achievement we will accomplish with Xfce 4.8 is "
"that, despite suffering from the small size of the development team from "
"time to time, the core of the desktop environment has been aligned with "
"today's desktop technologies such as GIO, ConsoleKit, PolicyKit, udev and "
"many more. A lot of old cruft like has been stripped from the core as well, "
"as has happened with HAL and ThunarVFS (which is still around for "
"compatibility reasons)."
