"This release incorporates major changes to the core of the Xfce desktop "

"requests. Among the most notable updates is the new application finder that "
"merges the functionality of the old appfinder and xfrun4. The Panel also has"
" a new vertical mode [aka Deskbar] for better space usage on wide-screen "
"monitors and a new actions plugin. On the settings side the settings helper "
"is integrated in xfsettingsd, saving 1 running process. There is also a "
"reworked settings dialog with categories and pluggable dialogs enabled by "
"default. Basic Synaptics and Wacom settings in the Mouse settings and a new "
"MIME-Type editor. Thunar gained a more polished layout to reduce space usage"
" and more responsive interaction with the thumbnail generator. Because we "
"have not decided on how to merge the desktop functionality into Thunar yet, "
"Xfdesktop has instead received various improvements, including single-click "
"support, desktop icon thumbnails and better pasting of files. The Session "
"Manager has improved power management code, tips have been removed and "
"cleanup sessions from the interface. Last but not least, the Window Manager "
"now has support for tiling windows and arrow key navigation in the task "
"switcher."

"Another big change for users is the removal of user documentation of the "

"href=\"http://docs.xfce.org\">docs.xfce.org</a>. The reason for this change "
"is the limited contribution of documentation since Xfce 4.8, so we hope the "
